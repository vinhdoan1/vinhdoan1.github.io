    <p class="aboutmetext">My name is Vinh Doan, and I am currently a student at the University of California, San Diego studying Computer Science. I have lived in the Bay Area my whole life, and quickly became fascinated with programming at the age of ten. I started to tinker around by making small games, and then began taking classes and self learning through online resources. Slowly, I transitioned to enjoying the challenges and fun of Computer Science and wanted to make it something I would pursue. Thus, I am now studying and loving my time at UCSD with Computer Science. Aside from also having developed 2 iOS applications, I love helping others discover the joys of programming. Over the summer of 2015, I was an instructor for <a href="https://www.coding4youth.org/" target="_blank">Coding4Youth</a>, and I am now currently working as a tutor for the UCSD CSE Department. Over the summer of 2016, I interned at Hologic. <a href="https://github.com/vinhdoan1/vinhdoan1.github.io/tree/master/hologic" target="_blank">Check out what I did during my time there!</a>. I am excited to announce that I will be interning at Facebook for the summer of 2017!

        Geom
        <p>Geom is a reimagined version of the classic game of Snake. This retro, black and white styles game's basic premise is to keep your snake tail long enough under a certain amount of time. There is also Challenge Mode, which tests the player's snake ability through several different challenges with goals.</p>

        2048 Flap
        <p>Based on the two hit games, Flappy Birds and 2048, 2048 Flap combines both into one suspenseful, thinking game. The board is split into 2 sides, one for tapping and jumping your block, and the other for swiping to move the column of blocks up or down. Aim to the 2048 block, and go for the high score!

    <div class="CircBox" id="projectBox">
        Circ
        <p>Based off the game TagPro, Circ takes the fun of childhood games such as Sharks and Minnows, and puts it into a local multiplayer game. Each player is a ball, and must outlast each of the other players. Developed in Java, and open sourced on <a href="https://github.com/vinhdoan1/Circ" target="_blank">GitHub!</a></p>
